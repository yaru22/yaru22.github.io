My first hackathon project at [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com/) NYC in June, 2012. I teamed up with Donald, Jack, Marisa and Shinji. Jack suggested the project idea the night before the hackathon and we all liked it because it was a creative and fun idea.

The concept of the project was this: rather than waking up to an annoying alarm clock, we built a service that connects two random people who want to wake up around the same time via a phone call so that they can wake up to an interesting conversation; hence the name wakie talkie.

We used Ruby on Rails and [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/) to make this.

We won a NYC regional prize and got to go to SF for the final round. We didn't win the grand prize at the fial round at SF, but it was a very fun experience.
