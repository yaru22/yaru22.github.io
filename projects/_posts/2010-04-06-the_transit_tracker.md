It was the fourth year design project in university (2009 - 2010). I was in a team with Jason Landry, Nathan Kwan and Stephen Edwards. We had an iPhone app idea for tracking public transit for this project. Jason hooked us up with [Trepeze Group](http://www.trapezegroup.com/), where one of his friends worked at. We worked with Trepeze Group to build the initial version of the iPhone app. We won the design project award and got $1,500 as the prize.
