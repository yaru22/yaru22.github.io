Google Docs for iPad/iPhone. It's part of Google Drive iOS. I worked on it after I finished mobile web app for Google Drive.

It was technically challenging but was a very interesting project. We used Obj-C, C++ and Javascript for this project. I worked on the layout engine, text formatting, implementing several UI elements and integrating the app with the Javascript interface.
