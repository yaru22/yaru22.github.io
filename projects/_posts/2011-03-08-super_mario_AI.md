Final project of [CS221: Artificial Intelligence](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/) at Stanford (Winter 2011). I took it as a Stanford Center for Professional Development course while working at Google.

The project is about making Super Mario dodge all the enemies and get to the finishing line as fast as possible. We implemented it using Java. We used [A* algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (one of the AI algorithms) and as you can see in the video above, it works quite well!
