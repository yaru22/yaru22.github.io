Started as a hackathon project at AngelHack Toronto. Hacked with Alex Kennberg in 24 hours. We didn't win any award but we liked the idea a lot so we co-founded Shopstarter and went full-time on it.

Shopstarter is an ecommerce platform that turns successfully crowdfunded campaign into ecommerce shop. We launched in January, 2013. As of September, 2013, we have over 50 shops with us and processed over several thousand transactions.
