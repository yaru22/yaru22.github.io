Mobile web application for Google Drive. It's the first major project I worked on while working at Google.

I was one of the three engineers who started and finished the project. It's built with [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/). I worked on most of the front-end engineering, as well as bridging Google Drive component (written in Java using GWT) and Google sharing feature (written in Javascript).
